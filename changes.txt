X-related:

* Change X depth determination to use default depth of screen instead of
maximum depth of screen.

Compiler-related:

* Compile everything explicitly with g++-2.95

* Include string.h, stdlib.h headers where needed

* Move inline function definitons into header files instead of C++ source files

* Remove profiling flags from compile flags

* Do not compile blendat utility, apparently due to changes in GTKMM library
it no longer compiles. This will be fixed at a later date. However, modern
Blender versions can use Python scripting for this kind of utility.

* Commented out unused variable EPSILON_VECTOR in texture.h
