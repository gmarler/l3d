Most important issues with L3D library code:

* Please download the latest code from http://l3d.sourceforge.net
* The code must be compiled with g++-2.95
* The "blendat" tool currently does not compile, apparently due to changes
in the GTKMM library. This issue is being investigated.
However, current versions of Blender include built-in scripting 
in the Python language. With Blender's current Python scripting
system, the solution method of blend_at is outdated (using an external
program to control Blender). Instead, it is better to write a Python 
script which can directly manipulate internal Blender data.

Other known issues

* Versions of g++ later than 2.95 may not reliably compile l3d.
g++-4.03 produces code with subtle errors, such as clipping errors.
Also some warnings appear during compilation with g++-4.03, that do not
appear when compiling with g++-2.95 (probably because of stricter checking
in g++-4.03). The l3d code can probably be updated to comply with later
g++ versions relatively easily, but the subtle clipping errors mentioned
above must be investigated.

* There may be math overflow conditions in the software rasterizer
due to range limitations of the fixed-point math calculations. These 
conditions will be flagged with an assertion message if the code is 
compiled in debug mode (compiler flags are set in the file Makefile.vars).
